Google Maps for Novius OS
====

An Novius OS application to create a Google map and display it.

Many thanks to Fumito Mizuno for his [OSM Application](https://github.com/ounziw/ounziw_osm) which helps me a lot to make my first app.

**Usage**

Add the folder Gmaps into your local/application folder

Make shure that your css does not set the value max-width of img to 100%.
If you are using noviusos_templates_basic, it is set in base.css

Reload the cache of admin pages. You can log out to do it.

Then install the app in app manager and you insert a google map in your pages.
